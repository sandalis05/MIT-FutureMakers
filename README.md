  In this program, I hope to gain foundational skills in AI so I can develop programs of my own, and I look forward to being a part of a collaborative learning environment

   From Dr. Kong's leadership seminar, I learned of how my though process and communication skills changed over the course of my childhood due to my exposure in different communities of sports. I realized how important my communication skill development was to the opportunities I've gained and the person I am, and I wonder how my new ability to adapt to new situations aided me in being able to reach out to communities and help them.

  I. Supervised learning is a model that is trained using pre-defined examples and "labels" while unsupervised learning is is when the program is given data and finds patterns and relationships from said data to make predictions.
  
  II. Scikit-Learn is built on top of visualization libraries like Graphviz and Pandas. Therefore, Scikit-Learn does not have the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
